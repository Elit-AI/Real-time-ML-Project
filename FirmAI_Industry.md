**Notes:**

- You can definitely park on both these and the people links to see if there are more out there. 
- In a way its required that you put these in a table format, possibly online drive file, doing this would further facilitate collaboration, and it would help to show which have and have not yet been added to this list. People can also more easily make there contribution. Good idea. However, this should only happen after this last purge, and above and beyond that purge, you should get someone that convert that information back and absorb it into excel. Oka lets have a lok. - Freelancer can be used. Would love this sort of updating. 
    - Another way of doing this is the simple porting mechanism. - You just make sure yhou clean it ou in the way  that you would clean out your draft on Dropbox paper too.
